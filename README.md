## 🔴About
While the teacher explains a basic math equation, Felix is distracted, doodling in his notebook. Being a fan of video games, 
he sketches a simple map and characters, imagining himself playing a game. To avoid drawing attention from the teacher, he includes 
the math equation in his notes, making it look like he's engaged in the lesson.
